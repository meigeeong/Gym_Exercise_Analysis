# Data Analysis Projects: Correlation and Linear Regression
## Overview
### -This jupyter notebook focus on understanding the relationships between different variables using correlation and linear regression techniques. 
### -These projects demonstrate the application of statistical methods to make predictions and interpret data effectively.

# Projects
## Title: Gym_Exercise_Anslysis
### Source of data: Kaggle
## 1. Correlation Analysis
## Objective: This project explores the relationship between different variables using correlation coefficients.

## Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

## Key Techniques:

### -Calculating Pearson correlation coefficient (ùëü) to measure the correlation between variables.
### -Visualizing correlation matrices using heatmaps.
### -A heatmap was used to visualize the strength and direction of correlations.

## 2. Linear Regression
## Objective: This project demonstrates the use of simple linear regression to predict a dependent variable using a single independent variable.
## Tools Used: Python, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib.

## Key Techniques:

### -Fitting a linear regression model.
### -Evaluating the model using R-squared to measure the goodness of fit.
### -Visualizing the regression line along with the data points.
### -In this study, I used Session Duration as an independent variable to predict Calories Burned. 
### -The regression line was plotted along with the data points, and the model's performance was evaluated using the score.
### -Moreover, for multiple regression model, I used Session_Duration (hours), Fat_Percentage, Experience_Level as independent variables to predict Calories Burned.
